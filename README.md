Mods for my WD My Cloud 6T

Here are the files that update the functionality of My Cloud 6T box. 

It's running **Firmware Release 4.04.01-112 (10/21/2015)**

I can now install **SickRage** and **Transmission** to My Cloud.

SickRage is an automatic Video Library Manager for TV Shows.

Transmission is a fast, easy and free BitTorrrent client.
